# Hydrogen-Bond-Analyzer
Gives useful statistics relating to hydrogen bonds in a simulated system molecules.

## TODO List:
- [ ] Test/improve h-bond lifetime calculator.
- [ ] Better format h-bond chains output.
- [ ] Compute average S<sub>HB</sub>(t) functions; use a certain frame interval (e.g. every 100 frames) and average frame 0 from all those samples, then frame 1, etc.
- [ ] Convert script (and update numpy) to use python 2.7 (maybe). This way, we can run the script on wooki.
- [ ] Documentation.
